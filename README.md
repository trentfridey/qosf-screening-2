# QOSF Screening Task (round 2)

In this screening task, I applied variational quantum circuits to investigate the [SWAP test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swap_test) using the [Pennylane API](https://pennylane.ai/qml/)

In the `task1` folder, there is a report PDF called `task1.pdf` which contains code, plots and an explanation.
The standalone code is provided in `task1.py`
